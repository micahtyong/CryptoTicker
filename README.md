CryptoTicker is a simple iOS app that uses the Cryptonator RESTful API to retrieve the latest cryptocurrency data in a user-centered fashion.

## Motivation ##

The motive behind this project was to build a simple and useful cryptocurrency exchange tool while building skills in Representational State Transfer API's which uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data. Responses are returned in a JSON format.
